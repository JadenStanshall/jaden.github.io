    Some projects I contributed to at Engineering Design Lab. On the left, the EDL Vehicle Control Unit (VCU). Below, a neat shot of the VCU. On the right, low voltage system of an electric delivery vehicle, a torque transducer, and a photo of my desk whlie writing peripheral drivers and verifying VCU hardware.

    Some projects I worked on at SEW Eurodrive; I had a considerable amount of ownership, if not complete ownership, over each project showcased here. Top left, some shots of mobile robot performing planning tasks in simulation. Top right, autonomous forklift to which I've contributed autonomous navigation, localization, and autonomous pick-up/drop-off capabilities. Bottom left, robot with simulated TOF camera observing a wall, later used for testing human/obstacle tracking and dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithms. Bottom right, description to be added. Below, also descriptin to be added.

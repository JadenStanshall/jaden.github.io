    <p style="margin: 10px 0;">Developing motion planning and perception systems for industrial autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). Brought corridor-constrained trajectory generation via free-space decomposition from proof of concept to the production AMR stack. Built a continuous integration framework for verifying robot behaviours in simulation. Implemented 2D SLAM using Google Cartographer with a long-range LiDAR. Implementing 3D occupancy mapping with ultrasonic range sensing, or ADAR (acoustic detection and ranging), for local obstacle avoidance, as well as LiDAR-based multi-object tracking.</p>
